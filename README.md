## Technologies Used

- **Next.js**: The foundation of this project, Next.js provides fast and reliable server-rendered React applications.
- **Typescript**: Bringing strong typing to your JavaScript, enhancing code quality.
- **React**: The popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **TailwindCSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for rapid development.

- **NextAuth**: Next.js authentication library with support for multiple providers.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone this repository**: Get your own copy of the project using `git clone`.

2. **Install dependencies**: Run `npm install` to install all the project dependencies.

3. **Configure Environment Variables**: Make sure to set up environment variables for your project. Refer to the `.env.example` file for required variables.

4. **Run the Development Server**: Use `npm run dev` to launch the Next.js development server.

5. **Explore and Customize**: Access your portfolio website at `http://localhost:3000`. Customize it to showcase your own projects and experiences.

## Deployment

This project is deployed with the help of Vercel! Changes pushed to individual branches build and allow preview before deploying which is helpful since we don't want to merge changes into master that we don't want built and deployed to the
primary site. In order to provide an consistent flow before merging changes to master, I use a `preview` branch to merge my changes and will soon automate merging of preview into master on a release schedule if changes are recognized on the preview
branch.
